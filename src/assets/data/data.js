Our World Cup campaign, however, ended in disappointment, with Australia taking home the trophy after prevailing over the men in blue in the final. There was heartbreak in this World Cup, but there were many moments that won the heart. This World Cup saw an all-round performance by the Indian team. Virat Kohli was judged the man of the tournament for his consistent performance through the World Cup. What's more, the ace batter broke the record of most ODI centuries by legend Sachin Tendulkar. On the bowling front, India's Mohammed Shami emerged the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.",

    desc: "The physical practice of yoga is actually quite well-suited for strength building for two reasons. The first is that it utilizes repetition. When we repeat a motion, whether it be a Chaturanga or Warrior II, we progressively fatigue our muscles which allows them to grow back stronger. Secondly, each posture in yoga has numerous modifications that allow us to make it easier or more difficult. Therefore, as yogis build strength, it’s easy to find more demanding and difficult progressions that will allow us to continue that growth. By utilizing reputation and adaptation, we’re able to achieve the principal of progressive overhead (i.e. increasing demand on the musculoskeletal system to gain strength, size, and endurance) just as we would in any other athletic discipline.",
